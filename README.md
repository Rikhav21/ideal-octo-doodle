# Dragon Game
## what is this?
This is a simple game that I made for the hackapet YSWS. It had to fit within 128 by 128 pixels, which is pat of why it does not look so good. The other part is just I am <i>really<i> bad at art.
##How did I make this?
I used Asperite for the pictures, and pygame for all of hte game logic. The majority of the time was spent making art while less than a few hours were spent on the game. Complitin with pygbag took so long that I even had to ask chatGPT what the problem was. (it turned out that I did not set pygbag as an enviroment variable. <i>I am sooo dumb<i>)
## How to run it
To run it all you need to do is install pygame, and run the main project file, but make sure that you do not change the directory for the images.
